### JavaScript's interaction with HTML is
### handled through events that occur
### when the user or the browser
### manipulates a page.

### When the page loads, it is called an
### event. When the user clicks a button,
### that click too is an event. Other
### examples include events like
### pressing any key, closing a window,
### resizing a window, etc.
##  _Onclick()_
